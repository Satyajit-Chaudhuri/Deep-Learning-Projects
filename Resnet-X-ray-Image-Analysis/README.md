# <font color = "blue"> Project Name: Analysis of Chest X-Ray images

## Premise: Neural networks have revolutionised image processing in several different domains. Among these is the field of medical imaging. In this project, we devise a model to work with Chest X-Ray (CXR) images.

## Objective: The objective of this exercise is to identify images where an "effusion" is present. This is a classification problem, where we will be dealing with two classes - 'effusion' and 'nofinding'. Here, the latter represents a "normal" X-ray image. 

## Methodology: This study uses Resnet model to predict the x-ray images.

## Tools used:

- Numpy

- Pandas

- Matplotlib

- Tensorflow

- Keras
